# 0.2.0 (unreleased)

## Added

- Added `SequentialFragment`, which marks fragments as requiring strict
  ordering semantics, and `AnyFragment` (which is a `SequentialFragment`).
  (2022-12-05; github #10)
- Added `importedEnums` to `SpecificationGroup`, to allow for a scoping
  workaround in resolving `Enumeration`s that are not otherwise in scope.
  (2022-11-02)

## Changed

- (BREAKING) Separated `UntilFragment` and `AnyFragment`.  The latter retains
  the `intraMessages` but is not a `BlockFragment`; the former is now a
  `SequentialFragment` and the erstwhile `body` is now `trigger`.  (`body` now
  refers to the part of the `UntilFragment` which runs _before_ `trigger`, ie
  that which was previously implicitly an `AnyFragment`.
